This repository contains code and resources related to the project "Tackling Complexity: EMODPS vs. DDPG for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning." The project explores and compares two algorithms, EMODPS (Evolutionary Multi-Objective Deep Policy Search) and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), for multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks.

Directory Structure:

EMODPS:

This directory contains code related to the EMODPS algorithm.
1- Swmm.py: Defines the SWMM class for running SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) simulations.
2- Swmm_Model.py: Implements the SWMM_Model class for running SWMM simulations based on actions generated by the EMODPS algorithm.
3- Optimization.py: Handles the optimization process using the BORG (Bi-objective Optimization with Robust Genetic Algorithm) algorithm.
